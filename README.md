## White Sands National Monument, New Mexico
The White Sands National Monument contains the world's largest gypsum dune field with an area of 710 square kilometers. Gypsum is rarely found in the form of sand and is most commonly used to make drywall. The dunes are known to be constantly changing in shape and location.  The purpose of this web page is to explain how we can tell how the dunes are changing.

## How do we map dune fields?
This is done through gathering LiDAR data. LiDAR, or LIght Detection And Ranging, is a method of surveying large areas of terrain by shooting laser beams out of usually an airplane at the surface of the Earth.  The laser beams return to the plane after they come into contact with something and they calculate elevation and classification of the terrain.
